## Inspiration
Everyone deserves an education but not everyone has the time, resources, or access. Our chatbot solves global education issues by allowing learning in small increments. In this chatbot, English speaking users seeking to learn Spanish will learn to read and write Spanish in tiny increments. 

## What it does
A tiny language academy that allows users to learn Spanish incrementally through micro-lessons and earning microbadges towards microcredentials. Everything is tiny in this UNIVERSItiny. 

* Users are given tiny lessons through messenger.

* Once users show proficiency for their tiny challenge, they are given a tiny badge and move on to the next lesson and challenge.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Because Spanish is a gendered language, once the user shares their preferred gender it's important for the chatbot to consistently refer to them in the appropriate gender.
