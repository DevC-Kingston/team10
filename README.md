## Inspiration
Everyone deserves an education but not everyone has the time, resources, or access. Our chatbot solves global education issues by allowing learning in small increments. In this chatbot, English speaking users seeking to learn Spanish will learn to read and write Spanish in tiny increments. Through conversation, in a brain friendly way, users will interact with the chatbot to learn vocabulary phrases, understand increasingly complex stories, and answer simple to more complex questions in Spanish (starting with yes/no then either/or and finally more open-ended questions). 

## What it does
A tiny language academy that allows users to learn Spanish incrementally through micro-lessons and earning microbadges towards microcredentials. Everything is tiny in this UNIVERSItiny. 

* Users are given tiny lessons through messenger.

* Once users show proficiency for their tiny challenge, they are given a tiny badge and move on to the next lesson and challenge. 

## List your Chatbotâ€™s features and use cases
1. Interactive and brain friendly language learning beyond learning discrete vocabulary words and phrases. Users will develop real frequency in a natural and intuitive way. 
2. Accessible to a wide variety of English-speaking learners using English translation strategically to ensure engagement and clarity while maximizing language development. Users can interact as much or as little with the system to develop their language proficiency. 


## How we built it
Tech Stack & Documentation:
* 1 Heroku Github
* 2 Flask (python)


## Challenges we ran into
1. Because Spanish is a gendered language, once the user shares their preferred gender it's important for the chatbot to consistently refer to them in the appropriate gender. 
2. We wanted to be able to consistently refer to the user by name and that proved to be more complicated than we thought it would be. 
3. Originally, we wanted to use UNIVERSItiny to teach coding but it required a level of content expertise to teach it that was beyond our skill level. Teaching Spanish was something that we had expertise within the group and that proved to be a good fit. 
 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* When automated responses finally occurred!
* All of our team members making it to the finish line. At first we didn't hear from Shannon and wondered if she'd dropped out. We reached out and it turns out that she was in the hospital for a few days. Her work proved to be invaluable and we could not have done this without her. It takes a team to do soething like this and we worked together well day and night. 


## What we learned
* YouTube was an invaluable resource. If we had to do this again, we would've started looking at youtube videos in week one when we first had our idea. 
* Getting "started" was the hardest part. It was challenging to figure out where the first step was. Choosing a language? Do more work on figuring out use case? Jumping in with a template?


## What's next for UNIVERSItiny
Product Roadmap - next features for example
1. Push notifications to encourage users to continue to engage for their language development. 
1. Personalizing the chatbot with the user's name and ensuring that engagement aligns with the user's identified gender (masculino or femenino)
