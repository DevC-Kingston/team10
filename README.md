## Inspiration
Everyone deserves an education but not everyone has the time, resources, or access. Our chatbot solves global education issues by allowing learning in small increments. 

## What it does
A "Byte" sized coding academy that allows users to learn coding incrementally through micro-lessons and earning microbadges towards microcredentials. Everything is tiny in this UNIVERSItiny. 

Users are given tiny lessons through messenger followed by tiny coding challenges to show proficiency.

Once users show proficiency for their tiny challenge, they are given a tiny badge and move on to the next lesson and challenge. 

With enough challenges completed users earn tiny cridentials.
