Fantástico!

Sometimes I’m going to tell you things and sometimes I’m going to ask you things. It’s okay if you don’t know all of the words. You’ll get a lot of repeticiones. That’s repetitions. Also you’ll notice that many words are the same or similar in English and Spanish like chocolate 🍫 televisión 📺 and música 🎶 

Are you ready? ¿Estás listo (or lista if feminine)?

[sí] 

Hay un muchacho
